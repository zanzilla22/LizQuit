Essentially a dark blob

Chromatids lined up on the middle

Chromosomes at either

Nucleolus reforms, two separate nuclei can be seen

Made of phospholipids, semi-permeable, acts as a gate between cells, pumps substances through active transport

Produces energy from sugars we eat, holds organelles in place

Network of fibres (microfilaments), structural support , runway that motor proteins use, attached to flagella and cilia

Protects DNA, holds instructions for a cell, has pores to allow for flow of materials, where ribosomal stuff is made

THE POWERHOUSE OF THE CELL, source of ATP, cristae to increase SA

Little dots in the cell, site of protein synthesis, larger in eukaryotes

Near nucleus, attached to ribosomes, makes protein, made of flattened membrane sacs

Makes steroids and lipids (eddie hall)

Flattened membrane sacs (cristae), makes carbs: pectin & cellulose/lysosomes in plants

Vacuoles (can be small in animal cells, cell wall, chloroplasts, fixed (angular) shape

Centrioles with a centromere area, flexible/round cell shape

Mostly in plants cells, store nutrients/sugars

Hold the cells together, made of cellulose, breakdown of macromolecules, gives plant cells angular shapes

Make thing green, filled with stroma, made of stacks of granum, 

PMAT (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase)

DNA supercoils; chromatin condenses further to sister chromatids, centrosomes move to opposite sides, spindle fibres form between centromeres

Spindle fibres attach to the centromeres, contract moving chromatids along the equator

Separation of sister chromatids forming chromosomes, reeled into opposite sides of the cell

Nucleolus reform, DNA has separated, microtubule disappear, cell elongates

Split of 2 genetically identical cells, pinching along the cleavage furrow (animal), proteins 7 cellulose fibres build new cell wall along equator

Cell specialization, cannot divide further, rest stage

Metabolic activity; increase volume of cytoplasm, organelles created, protein synthesized

Synthesis; DNA is made synthesized & replicated

Increase volume of cytoplasm again, centrioles replicate, DNA condenses around histones forming chromatin

G0, G1, S, G2, PMAT, Cytokinesis, G0

Holds together chromatids

Further condensed chromatin

Tend to be encapsulated, puts pressure on surrounding tissue, easy to remove

Fucking cancer lmao, spreads through metastasis

Abnormal growth of tissue

Can continuously go through mitosis,

Most valuable, 8-16 stage, embryotic stem cells

Can differentiate into many but not all types

Can differentiate into several closely related cells; bone marrow to blood cells, urine cells to produce kidneys

Can regenerate but only has one function

Helps regenerative, can cure many diseases by replacing cells, easy to grow for totipotent

None

Embryotic stem cell research, economic disparity for umbilical cell storage

Absorbing nutrients (breaking down to fat, sugar etc), decomposing food

Food taken into the body (eating)

Food broken down physically (mastication) & chemically (enzymatic hydrolysis)

Through small (nutrients absorbed) & to some degree large intestine (water reabsorbed)

Digested food products converted into fluid/solid parts of cell/tissue (turning food into shit ur body needs)

Undigested food residue is egested (literally shitted out)

Teeth, stomach (churning), small intestine (segmentation)

Enzymatic hydrolysis through stomach acid, bile & enzymes

J shaped organ where food is broken down, called chime

Most nutrients at this point have been absorbed, DJ ellem is: Duodenum, jejunum, ilem, has microvilli

Produces vitamin K, water reabsorbed, appendix is there, has cecum, colon, rectum, anus

Where feces is stored, asshole pushed through with peristalsis, is muscular

Accessory organ, produces bile which breaks fat down into globules

Accessory organ, stores bile

Accessory organ, pancreatic juices that neutralizes stomach acids by releasing sodium bicarbonate in the small intestine, produces insulin & glucagon 

Accessory organ, releases saliva w/ enzymes

Acts as a "detergent", Does not destroy fat, it breaks it apart into smaller molecules, Comprised of: Cholesterols,  Bile salts, Bilirubin

Enzyme that digests protein

Enzyme that digests lipids

Enzyme that digests carbs

Increased SA to increase absorption, in the small intestine, has microvilli attached to it

Bringing oxygen/gasses into and out of your body

Exchange (diffusion) of o2 & co2 to and from the blood at alveoli, helps repair tissues, gasses of high concentration will spread out into areas of low concentration

Cellular respiration, O2 + c6h12o6 and turn it into co2 + h2o (how cells use oxygen)

Inspiration, air taken into the lungs, intercostal relaxes & diaphragm moves up

Diaphragm relaxes, intercostal tenses, air rushes out of the lungs

Lined with tiny hairs/mucus/cilia to trap dust & other airborne particles

mout.

Common to both digestive & respiratory systems, stopped by epiglottis

Flap that opens/closes to not let food go down trachea

Voice box, located at top of trachea, made of cartilage, vibrates to create noise

Windpipe, has Adams apple, thyroid, cartilage, cricoid cartilage, 10-12 cm in length, walls lined with more cillia

Branch off from trachea & enter lungs, Bronchioles lead to alveoli, sort of like arteries/arterials 

No muscles in the lung tissue (still expand & contract)

External/external, expand and contract

Causes differences in gas pressure, can expand/contract lungs

Pulmonary capillaries w/thin membranes to minimize diffusion difference, inner surface covered with surfactant, spherical to increase SA

Type 1: single cell layer forming walls of alveolus, permeable, Type 2 is like life support for type 1, secreting surfactant, 5% of alveoli SA

Layer of disinfectant fluid, keeps alveoli from collapsing, makes it "puffy" (rubber glove example), moist inner lining

Also very thin membranes, allows oxygen/gasses to pass through easily, minimizing diffusion distance

Gasses of high concentration will spread out into areas of low concentration, 

Plasma, Leucocytes, Erythrocytes, Platelets

Dehydration in lack, dissolves/carries out other components of blood (nutrients/waste)

Leucocytes, fighting infection in excess

Transports oxygen (hgb), matured RBC do not need nuclei

Clotting of blood after damage to cells/rbcs, only cell fragments, found within WBC, forms a net to stop cells from bleeding out (fibrin)

Right: takes deoxygenated blood from vena cava, left: input red, oxygenated blood coming from lungs 

Right: not much pressure, thinner muscles, only needs to push to the lungs which are closer. Left: much more resistance/muscle, pumps oxygenated blood to the aorta

Arteries that carry blood to your body, very thick & muscular

Blocks the backwards flow of blood, otherwise deoxygenated blood could flow back into capillaries (can be atrioventricular or semilunar)

"Hoses", blood pushed away from the heart (carrying high pressure blood), thick/muscular

Very tiny/thin walls, can reach every cell in the body, exchange of materials/gasses can happen

Thinner walled, do not need big push of energy (low pressure blood transport back to the heart)

Smaller veins that lead to the arteries

"Plumbing thing", tubes are blocked, heart cannot receive oxygen/nutrients, does not beat properly

"head" of the nerve cell

Receives signals from other nerve cells

Elongated fibre transmitting signals to terminal regions, other neurons & effectors

Myelinate nerve cells, myelin sheath is to insulate/keep signal within the cell, have gaps

Gap within the myelin sheath so it can hop through axon

Cell body, where the nucleus is

Brain, spinal chord

Adjusts body to variations in external/internal environments without having to think about it

Sympathetic/parasympathetic, maintains homeostasis

Motor division; Autonomic, Somatic

Controllable (voluntary) input, effectors, carry info from external environment inward

Sensory division, efferent division, somatic division

Involuntary, Fight or flight

Pupils dilate, lose control of bladder, releasing glucose into blood, neurotransmitters epinephrine & norepinephrine break sugar, increase blood pressure/heart rate and rush adrenaline

Rest or digest, acetylcholine brings back down from adrenaline
